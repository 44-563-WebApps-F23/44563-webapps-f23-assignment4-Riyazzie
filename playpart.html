    <h1>Riyaz acts in a play</h1>
    <h3> An enemy of the people by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
    <p><b>Dr. Stockmann.</b><br>
        This article is only a beginning. I have already got
        four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?</p>
        
       <p> <b>Billing</b>
        <p >(calls into the printing-room).</p> Aslaksen, just come here for a
        minute!</p>
        
        <p><b>Hovstad. </b><br>
            Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?</p>
        
        <p><b>Dr. Stockmann.</b><br> Noâ€”far from it, my dear fellow. No, they are about
        quite another matter. But they all spring from the question of the
        water supply and the drainage. One thing leads to another, you know. It
        is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.</p>
        
        <p><b>Billing.</b><br> Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you
        have pulled all the old rubbish down.</p>
        
        <p><b>Aslaksen</b><br> 
        <p>(coming in).</p>Pulled down? You are not thinking of pulling down
        the Baths surely, Doctor?</p>
        
        <p><b>Hovstad. </b><br>Far from it, don't be afraid.</p>
        
        <p><b>Dr. Stockmann. </b><br>No, we meant something quite different. Well, what do
        you think of my article, Mr. Hovstad?</p>
        
        <p><b>Hovstad. </b><br>I think it is simply a masterpiece.</p>
